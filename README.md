# Java_Decompiler
Run this script to decompile all .class / .jar files back to .java files! The hierarchy of the files remains the same!

## GUIDE:

>###### NOTE:
>Make sure there are two folders already made:
"classesFolder", "decompileFolder".

Place ALL your desired ".class / .jar" files to de-compress inside the "classesFolder".

Run the "decompile.bat" file - FOR WINDOWS.

Run the "decompile.sh" file - FOR UNIX.

ALL your desired de-compiled files are place in the "decompileFolder".

ENJOY!
